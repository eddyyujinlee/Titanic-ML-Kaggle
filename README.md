# 🚢 Titanic ML Project - Kaggle

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting passenger survival using Titanic dataset features.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and model training
- `reports/` → Final reports and insights
- `submissions/` → Kaggle competition submission files

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic-ml-project.ipynb


## 🏆 Results
- **Best Model:** Stacking Ensemble (XGBoost + Random Forest + Logistic Regression)
- **Accuracy:** **82.12%**
- **AUC-ROC:** **0.905**

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Fare, Pclass, Sex, and Title** were the most important survival predictors.
- Feature engineering improved model performance significantly.
- SHAP analysis provided transparency into model decisions.
